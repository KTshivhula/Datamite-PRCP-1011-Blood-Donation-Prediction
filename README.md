\# 🩸 Blood Donation Prediction



\## 📌 Project Overview

Every year, millions of patients need blood transfusions, but blood supply depends on volunteer donors. This project predicts whether a donor will give blood again in March 2007 based on their donation history. The goal is to help blood drives \*\*target likely donors\*\*, reducing costs and improving blood supply planning.



\*\*Dataset:\*\* Mobile blood donation vehicle records from a university in Taiwan.  

\*\*Target:\*\* `Made Donation in March 2007` (1 = donated, 0 = did not donate)

\## 🎯 Key Results



| Model | Accuracy | ROC AUC | Best For |

|-------|----------|---------|----------|

| \*\*Logistic Regression\*\* | 60.3% | \*\*0.6885\*\* ✅ | Ranking donors (production) |

| Random Forest | 73.3% | 0.6575 | Minimizing false alarms |

| Decision Tree | 65.5% | 0.6187 | Baseline interpretation |



\*\*Production Recommendation:\*\* Logistic Regression – highest ROC AUC, simple, interpretable, and prioritizes \*\*recall\*\* (catching actual donors).

\## 📊 Dataset



\- \*\*Donors:\*\* 576  

\- \*\*Donation rate (March 2007):\*\* 24% (imbalanced – only 1 in 4 donated)  

\- \*\*Features:\*\*

&#x20; - `Months since Last Donation`

&#x20; - `Number of Donations`

&#x20; - `Total Volume Donated (c.c.)`

&#x20; - `Months since First Donation`



\### Class imbalance challenge

A naive model predicting "no donation" would be 76% accurate but useless. We addressed imbalance with `class\_weight='balanced'` and stratified train/test splits.

\## 📈 Exploratory Data Insights



| Feature | Donors vs Non‑donors |

|---------|----------------------|

| \*\*Months since Last Donation\*\* | Donors have shorter recency (median \~2 months) |

| \*\*Number of Donations\*\* | Donors have higher frequency (median \~7) |

| \*\*Total Volume Donated\*\* | Donors have donated more total blood |

| \*\*Months since First Donation\*\* | Donors have longer history (loyalty) |



\*Boxplots and histograms in the notebook confirm these patterns.\*
